                                Through the technical assistance from the Tanzania Commission for Science Technology
		                        (COSTECH), TIRDO Energy Division has acquired state of the art equipment for analyzing
		                         coal (and other energy materials) quality.  After commissioning the equipments in 2015,
		                        the Division’s coal laboratory is capable to analyze the materials with respect to proximate,
		                         ultimate and heating value parameters. It is further capable to analyze the inorganic content
			                    (trace metals) from the materials. To-date, the laboratory has analyzed over 60 coal samples 
			                     from the mining companies.<br>
                                 In recognition of this capacity and, especially after the coal laboratory managed to resolve coal 
		                         quality disputes between mining companies and coal users (e.g. the Dangote Cement Factory Vs. 
		                        TANCOAL mine case), the Minister for Energy and Minerals, Prof. Sospeter Muhongo declared the TIRDO 
		                       coal laboratory as the national backstop reference laboratory for coal quality assessment for Tanzania.

                                TIRDO was awarded the contract to carry out  non destructive testing on pipelines and gas facilities. 
                                The work included the furnishing of labour,  supervision, materials, equipment, small tools and any other 
                                services necessary  to perform non destructive examination (NDE) on the offshore and on shore  pipelines as
                                per plans and standards.<br>
                                The Marine pipeline was approximately 5.2km long  and the onshore portion of the pipeline was about 26 km 
			                   long pipeline from Msimbati Peninsula  to the South Shore of Mnazi Bay near Kelinde river and extend the pipeline
			                    to  Mtwara Municipal where TANESCO generates power.<br>
                                The project was carried out successful according to the ISO standards.

                            <p class="about_hub">
                                TIRDO has been implementing traceability systems in the main agro  chain since 2004. First it was a pilot scheme in 
                                the main exports i.e. coffee,  cashwenut, tea, freshwater fish and seafood; co-funded by DANIDA and The Government  of 
                                Tanzania. The pilot scheme was very successful in traceability system were  implemented in coffee, tea, cashwenut, freshwater
                                 and seafood. The project is  now extended to other sub-sectors such as horticulture, meat and honey, and is  being 
                                 upgraded to computerised system.

                                        Role players in main  agro-exports including coffee, tea, cashew nut, freshwater fish and seafood,  have been sensitized 
                                        and trained on traceability systems

                            <h4>Value addition on Plastic waste and mitigation of environment pollution of plastic waste.</h4>
                            <p style="text-align:justify">
                                TIRDO in collaboration with UNIDO had set up a plastic recycling plant with the aim of demonstrating 
                                the plastic recycling process as well as training SME’s on the recycling technology. More than 300 people
                                 were trained through this program.

                                Among the SME’s that were trained, some established their own min plastic recycling factories /plants and
                                 employed others. Through this project plastic wastes have become a valuable raw material for the recycling 
                                 plants and hence plastic wastes have been reduced significantly.

                                The main achievement of the project is the spill over where by it has created employment for the SME’s, 
                                the people hired in factories, the waste collectors and the waste distributors.
