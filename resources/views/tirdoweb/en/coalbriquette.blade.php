                            TIRDO is implementing a project that uses a coal dust which would otherwise result into waste to process briquettes for domestic use.
                             The project is done in collaboration with STAMCO, whereby a pilot plant was set up at TIRDO
                                for production of the coal briquettes. The plant produces 2 tons of coal briquette per hour.
